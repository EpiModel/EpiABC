Title: Efficient Approximate Bayesian Computation Sampling Schemes
Description: Enables launching a series of simulations of a computer code from the 
    R session, and to retrieve the simulation outputs in an appropriate format for 
    post-processing treatments. Five sequential sampling schemes and three coupled-to-MCMC 
    schemes are implemented.
